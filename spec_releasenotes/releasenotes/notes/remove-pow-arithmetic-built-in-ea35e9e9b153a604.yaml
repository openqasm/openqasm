    Removed the `pow` function from the built-in arithmetic functions list in the specification.
    The `pow` function could not be parsed by the reference grammar because it conflicted with
    the `pow` gate modifier. It was also not mentioned in the OpenQASM 3 paper. Use the `**`
    operator instead.
