    The ``qubit`` type is no longer a valid base type for an ``array``, and it is no longer stated
    that the register type ``qubit[n]`` is equivalent to an ``array``; there is no need for these
    semantics, and they clashed with the classical considerations and alignment concerns of arrays
    in general.
