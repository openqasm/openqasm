# OpenQASM Working Groups

As outlined in the OpenQASM [governance document](governance.md), the Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
will, from time to time, elect to create **Working Groups** (WG) to study issues. The TSC will appoint a **Contributor**
as **Chair** for each WG. A WG shall submit a language RFC or pull request to the OpenQASM specification
for review by the TSC at an agreed upon date. A WG will be automatically disbanded upon acceptance or
(final) rejection of the RFC/pull request.

## Current Working Groups

### Profiles

**Objective**: Define a minimum set of features for hardware implementors (basic
profile) and a framework for structuring additional profiles.

**Description**:
One of the core tenets of OpenQASM 3.0 is _versatility_, and in particular the idea that not all hardware and tooling needs to support all OpenQASM 3.0 features. A hardware implementor can assume that certain aspects of compilation are dealt with at a higher-level, and can focus their implementation on only core features of the language.

This working group will group various aspects of the language into "featuresets", and then create profiles which are a collection of those featuresets.

This WG will draw inspiration from a complementary effort in the QIR project: https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/Base_Profile_Workstream.md

**Questions**:
- What additional profiles which would be useful?
- Is it possible to define an OpenQASM 2.0 profile that would certify that a tool is backwards compatible.

**Completion of WG**:
This working group will have completed its efforts when:

- All features have been defined and grouped into featuresets.
- At least one profile has been defined.

## Past Working Groups

### Generics and circuit families

**Objective**: Recommend what range of generics / parameterised circuit family functionality (beyond angle parameters) would be suitable for inclusion in OpenQASM, and what syntax should be used for it.

Chair: Niel de Beaudrap
Members: Colm Ryan, Andrew Cross, Ali Javadi, Blake Johnson, Matthew Amy

**Outcome**: The primary outcome was https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/pull/346
which proposes modifying the gate syntax to allow classical gate parameters to have
types other than angle, and to allow gates to accept quantum registers of a
specified size.

### OpenPulse

**Objective**: Define a pulse grammar "openpulse" to be used for microcoding of gate instructions with
OpenQASM `defcal`'s.

Chair: Thomas Alexander (IBM Quantum)  
Members: Blake Johnson, Colm Ryan, Derek Bolt, Peter Karalekas, Lauren Capelluto, Michael Healy, Prasahnt Sivarajah, Yunong Shi, Steven Heidel

### Types and casting

**Objective**: Define type hierarchy and implicit casting rules.
**Questions**:

 * Any implicit casts?
 * What explicit casts are allowed?
 * Registers vs arrays?
 * Can you index into integers and get bit value?
 * Is an int equivalent to an array of bits?

Chair: Michael Healy (IBM Quantum)
Members: Niel de Beaudrap, Hiroshi Horii, Blake Johnson, Colm Ryan, Luciano Bello, Prasahnt Sivarajah, Yunong Shi, Jake Lishman, Bettina Heim

### Dynamic Dereference & Allocation

**Objectives**: Formulate response to issues raised by [Physical mapping of dynamically dereferenced qubits #307](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/issues/307)
 * Provide concrete examples proving this cannot be dealt with in OpenQASM 3 as the spec stands
 * If in scope, provide rough solutions.
 * Keep in mind the difference between dynamic dereference and dynamic allocation.
 * Capture implicit assumptions that would make it hard to introduce this in future.

**Questions**:
 * Do dynamically dereferenced qubits break hidden assumptions in the current spec?
    * Gates may have different implementations for each dynamic qubit
    * Multiple qubit gates require connectivity or swaps
    * Index out of bounds in runtime?

Chair: Dor Israeli (Quantum Machines)
Members: Thomas Alexander (IBM Quantum), Niel de Beaudrap (Sussex), Philipp Schindler (Innsbruck), Bettina Heim (Microsoft)

Group was merged into part of the profiles and releases working group.

### Pragmas

**Objectives**: Define a pragma syntax, standard directives, the standard behavioral expectations for interacting within a toolchain.
**Questions**:

 * What should be the pragma syntax? Should there be more directives (e.g., `#if`, `#define`), or should the functionality avoid anything like a pre-processor?
 * What should be supported in the language instead of as a pragma?
 * What is not supported by pragmas
 * Conventions:
    * How should multiple OpenQASM tools interact with pragmas?
    * How do pragmas that may operate at different levels of the MLIR different stages of processing determine when and where to be processed?
    * Syntactical conventions for independent developers
