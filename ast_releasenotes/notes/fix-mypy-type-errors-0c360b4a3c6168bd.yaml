    Fixed all existing MyPy type checking errors in the codebase. The changes
    improve type safety and code maintainability by adding proper type annotations
    and fixing type inconsistencies. Additionally, auto-generated ANTLR parser
    files are now excluded from MyPy checks via configuration.
