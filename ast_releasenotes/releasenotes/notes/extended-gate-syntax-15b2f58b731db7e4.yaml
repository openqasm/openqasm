    Introduces a new ast node type ``QuantumExtendedGateDefinition``` where the arguments
    are ``List[ClassicalType]`` instead of ``List[Indentifier]``. A new node type was
    introduced in order to avoid breaking backward compatibility with prior versions of
    the reference parser. Consumers of the AST should now check for this new node type in
    addition to the previously existing ``QuantumGateDefinition``.
