features:
  - |
    A new function, :func:`.parse_version`, can extract the version number
    from an OpenQASM program without parsing the entire input.  This can be
    used to detect the version number and dispatch to the correct version of
    a custom parser.
  - |
    The function :func:`.parse` has a new keyword argument ``ignore_version``,
    which can be set ``True`` to suppress the error on an incorrect version,
    although the output AST may not be correct in this instance.
fixes:
  - |
    The parser will now correctly reject OpenQASM programs that report a
    language version the parser does not support.
