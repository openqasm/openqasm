    Comment preservation support has been added to the ANTLR grammar. Line comments
    (``//``) and block comments (``/* */``) are now directed to the HIDDEN channel
    instead of being skipped entirely. This enables formatting tools, IDEs, and other
    language processors to preserve comments when processing OpenQASM code, improving
    the developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility with existing
    parsers that ignore comments.
