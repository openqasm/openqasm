features:
  - |
    Added QuantumCallExpression AST node to support parsing of measurement
    statements such as `measure_iq $0` and `measure_rotated(pi) $0` where the
    measurement function is not named `measure` or accepts classical arguments.
    The parser already supported defining such a measurement operations using,
    e.g., `defcal measure_iq q -> complex[float[32]] { ... }` but the resulting
    operation could not be called.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed calling measurement operations defined via `defcal` statements.
    Previously such operations could only be called if they were named
    `measure` and had no classical parameters.
