features:
  - |
    Added QuantumMeasurementGeneric AST node to support parsing of measurement
    statements such as `measure_iq $0` where the measurement function is not
    named `measure`. The parser already supported defining such a measurement
    operation using `defcal measure_iq q -> complex[float[32]] { ... }` but
    the resulting operation could not be called.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed calling measurement operations defined via `defcal` statements.
    Previously such operations could only be called if they were named
    `measure`.
