    Fixed all existing MyPy type checking errors in the codebase. The changes
    improve type safety and code maintainability by adding proper type annotations
    and fixing type inconsistencies. Additionally, auto-generated ANTLR parser
    files are now excluded from MyPy checks via configuration.

    The AST nodes ``QuantumReset``, ``DelayInstruction``, and ``Box`` are now
    of type ``Statement`` rather than ``QuantumStatement`` because they may not
    appear inside a gate definition.
