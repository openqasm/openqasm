Language
========

OpenQASM refers to the extended language we now describe, specifically
OpenQASM Version 3.0.

The human-readable form of OpenQASM is a simple, case-sensitive textual language.
Statements are separated by semicolons and whitespace is ignored.

In other respects, OpenQASM possesses a dual nature as an assembly language and
as a hardware description language.

The OpenQASM grammar specifications can be found atÂ `[OpenQASM 3.0 Grammar] <../grammar/index.html>`__.
