OpenPulse Grammar
=================

OpenQASM allows users to provide the target system's implementation of quantum operations
with ``defcal`` blocks . Calibration grammars are open to extension for system implementors. In
this document, we outline one such grammar, OpenPulse, which may be selected within a supporting
compiler through the declaration defcalgrammar "openpulse" <VERSION>.

This grammar is motivated by the original OpenPulse specification, a JSON wire-format for
pulse-level quantum programs defined in the paper `Qiskit Backend Specifications for OpenQASM
and OpenPulse Experiment`_:cite:`mckay2018`. The textual format described
here has several advantages over the original JSON format:

- Improved readability
- Pulse timing is based on instruction ordering and works with programs containing branching
  control flow
- Reusable gate calibrations enable more succinct calibration descriptions.
- Pulse definitions are declared as a calibration for individual circuit instructions attached to
  physical qubits enabling the microcoding of gate level operations.
- Richer ability to compose complex pulses through natural DSP-like operations.
- Clearly defined relationship between pulses, channels and the phases of compilation to
  hardware resources.
- Use of multiple frames on a single channel at the same time (see :ref:`Geometric gate`)


Openpulse provides a flexible programming model that should extend to many quantum control schemes
and hardware. At the core of the OpenPulse grammar are the concepts of ``frames``.
``frames`` are used to schedule the playing of a ``waveform`` or capturing of data
via a ``channel`` on the target device. A channel is a software abstraction which allows the
programmer to be agnostic to complexities of the device's underlying pulse generation hardware. It
is the responsibility of the target device's compiler to map ``frames`` to the applied channels in
target hardware.


Channels
--------

Channels map to a hardware resource, which can play pulses to manipulate a qubit
or capture data from the qubit to perform a measurement. There is a many-to-many
relationship between qubits and channels. One qubit may have multiple channels
connecting to it. Pulses on different channels would have different physical
interactions with that qubit. A channel may also have many qubits. For instance,
a channel could manipulate the coupling between two neighboring qubits, or
could even reference multiple qubits in a chain.

Channels are vendor-specific and device-specific. It is expected that vendors
of quantum hardware provide the appropriate channel names and qubit mappings
as configuration information to end users. Each channel may also have associated
static settings, such as local-oscillator frequencies, which do not vary
throughout program execution. Again it is expected that vendors of quantum
hardware provide a method for manipulating those static settings if appropriate.

There are two kinds of channels: transmit channels (sending input to a quantum
device) and receive channels (reading output from a quantum device).

A channel is only used to specify the physical resource on which to play a pulse or from which
to capture data. This specification should be done by providing a mapping between a qubit list +
name and the configured hardware channel. The hardware can then be accessed as
OpenPulse ``txchannel``/``rxchannel``'s via "get" functions.

.. code-block:: c

    txch(qubit q0, ..., qubit qn, str name) -> txchannel  // get transmit channel
    rxch(qubit q0, ..., qubit qn, str name) -> rxchannel  // get receive channel

The qubits must be **physical** qubits. Furthermore, ordering of qubits is important. For instance,
``txch($0, $1, "control")`` and ``txch($1, $0, "control")`` may be used to implement distinct
cross-resonance gates. It is also possible to access a channel by its full name, without supplying
any qubits, if that has between implemented by the vendor. For instance, ``txch("<channel_name>")``
may refer to a transmit channel with an arbitrary name.

.. code-block:: c

    txchannel d0 = txch($0, "drive");  // channel for driving at qubit $0's freq
    txchannel cr1_2 = txch($1, $2, "coupler");  // channel for a coupler between two qubits
    txchannel m2 = txch($2, "measure");  // channel for transmitting measurement stimulus

    // capture channels for capturing qubits $0 and $1
    rxchannel cap0 = rxch($0, "capture");
    rxchannel cap1 = rxch($1, "capture");

Frames
------

When interacting with qubits, it is powerful to track of a frame of reference, akin to the rotating
frame of a Hamiltonian, throughout the execution of a program. Openpulse provides the ``frame``
type which is responsible for tracking two properties:

- Tracking time appropriately so programs do not need to deal in absolute time or with the
  bookkeeping of advancing time in a sequence of pulses.
- Tracking phase by producing a complex value given an input time (i.e. via the mathematical
  relationship :math:`e^{i\left(2\pi f t + \theta\right)}`,  where `f` is frequency and
  :math:`\theta` is phase). One motivation for keeping track of phase is to allow pulses to be
  defined in the rotating frame with the effect being an equivalent application in the lab
  frame (i.e. with the carrier supplied by the ``frame``). Another motivation is to more naturally
  implement a "virtual Z-gate", which does not require a physical pulse but rather shifts the phase
  of all future pulses on that frame.

The frame is composed of three parts:

1. A frequency ``frequency`` of type ``float``.
2. A phase ``phase`` of type ``angle``.
3. A time which is manipulated implicitly and cannot be modified other
   than through existing timing instructions like ``delay`` and ``barrier``. The time increment
   is determined by the channel on which the frame is played (see :ref:`Timing` section).

The ``frame`` type is a virtual resource and the exact precision of these parameters is
hardware specific. It is thus up to the compiler to choose how to implement the required
transformations to physical resources in hardware (e.g. mapping multiple frames to a
single NCO).

Frame Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frames can be constructed using the ``newframe`` command e.g.

.. code-block:: javascript

  frame driveframe = newframe(5e9, 0.0); // newframe(float[size] frequency, angle[size] phase)

would construct a frame with frequency `f`  5 GHz and phase :math:`\theta` 0.0. When
instantiated, the frame time starts at 0. ``frame``s can also be copied using the
``copyframe`` command

.. code-block:: javascript

  frame driveframe1 = newframe(5e9, 0.0);
  frame driveframe2 = copyframe(driveframe1);
  driveframe2.phase = driveframe1.phase + pi/2;

This will generate a ::math:`pi/2` phase incremented copy of ``driveframe1`` with the same
time as `driveframe1`.

Frame manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (frequency, phase) tuple of a frame can be manipulated throughout program
by referencing ``.frequency``, and ``.phase``. Operations must be
appropriate for the respective type, ``float`` for frequency and ``angle`` for
phase. Again, the exact precision of these calculations is hardware specific.

Here's an example of manipulating the phase to calibrate an ``rz`` gate on a frame called
``driveframe``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Example 1: Shift phase of the "drive" frame by pi/4, eg. an rz gate with angle -pi/4
   cal {
     driveframe.phase += pi/4;
   }

   // Example 2: Define a calibration for the rz gate on all 8 physical qubits
   cal {
     frame[8] rz_frames;
     frame[0] = newframe(...);
     // and so on
   }

   defcal rz(angle[20] theta) $q {
     rz_frames[q].phase -= theta;
   }

Manipulating frames based on the state of other frames is also permitted:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Swap phases between two frames
   const temp = frame1.phase;
   frame1.phase = frame2.phase;
   frame2.phase = temp;

Waveforms
---------

Waveforms are of type ``waveform`` and can either be:

- An array of complex samples which define the points for the waveform envelope
- An abstract mathematical function representing a waveform. This will later be
  materialized into a list of complex samples, either by the compiler or the hardware
  using the parameters provided to the pulse template.

A value of type ``waveform`` is retrieved by explicitly constructing the complex samples
or by calling one of the built-in waveform template functions. The latter are initialized by
assigning a ``waveform`` to the result of a (kernel) function call. Note that each of these
kernel functions takes a type ``length`` as a first argument, since waveforms need to have a
definite length. Using the hardware dependent ``dt`` unit is recommended for this length,
since the compiler may need to down-sample a higher precision waveform to physically realize it.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // arbitrary complex samples
   waveform arb_waveform = [1+0*j, 0+1*j, 1/sqrt(2)+1/sqrt(2)*j];

   // amp is waveform amplitude at center
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   // sigma is the standard deviation of waveform
   kernel gaussian(complex[size] amp, length l, length sigma) -> waveform;

   // amp is waveform amplitude at center
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   // sigma is the standard deviation of waveform
   kernel sech(complex[size] amp, length l, length sigma) -> waveform;

   // amp is waveform amplitude at center
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   // square_width is the width of the square waveform component
   // sigma is the standard deviation of waveform
   kernel gaussian_square(complex[size] amp, length l, length square_width, length sigma) -> waveform;

   // amp is waveform amplitude at center
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   // sigma is the standard deviation of waveform
   // beta is the Y correction amplitude, see the DRAG paper
   kernel drag(complex[size] amp, length l, length sigma, float[size] beta) -> waveform;

   // amp is waveform amplitude
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   kernel constant(complex[size] amp, length l) -> waveform;

   // amp is waveform amplitude
   // l is the overall length of the waveform
   // frequency is the frequency of the waveform
   // phase is the phase of the waveform
   kernel sine(complex[size] amp, length  l, float[size] frequency, angle[size] phase) -> waveform;

We can manipulate the ``waveform`` types using the following signal processing functions to produce
new waveforms (this list may be updated as more functionality is required).

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Multiply two input waveforms entry by entry to produce a new waveform
    // :math:`wf(t_i) = wf_1(t_i) \times wf_2(t_i)`
    kernel mix(waveform wf1, waveform wf2) -> waveform;

    // Sum two input waveforms entry by entry to produce a new waveform
    // :math:`wf(t_i) = wf_1(t_i) + wf_2(t_i)`
    kernel sum(waveform wf1, waveform wf2) -> waveform;

    // Add a relative phase to a waveform (ie multiply by :math:`e^{\imag \theta}`
    kernel phase_shift(waveform wf, angle ang) -> waveform;

Play instruction
----------------

Waveforms are scheduled using the ``play`` instruction. These instructions may
only appear inside a ``defcal`` block and have three required parameters:

- the channel on which to play the pulse
- a value of type ``waveform`` representing the waveform envelope
- the frame to use for the pulse

.. code-block:: javascript

  play(channel chan, waveform wfm, frame fr)

For example,

.. code-block:: javascript

  defcal play_my_pulses {
   // Play a 3 sample pulse on the tx0 channel
   play(tx0, [1+0*j, 0+1*j, 1/sqrt(2)+1/sqrt(2)*j], driveframe);

   // Play a gaussian pulse on the tx1 channel
   frame f1 = newframe(q1_freq, 0.0);
   play(tx1, gaussian(...), f1);
  }

Capture Instruction
-------------------

Acquisition is scheduled by a ``capture`` instruction. This is a special
``kernel`` function which is specified by a hardware vendor. The measurement
process is difficult to describe generically due to the wide variety of
hardware and measurement methods. Like the play instruction, these instructions
may only appear inside a ``defcal`` block!

The only required parameters are the ``channel`` and the ``frame``.

The following are possible parameters that might be included:

- A "duration" of type ``length``, if it cannot be inferred from other parameters.
- A "filter" of type ``waveform``, which is dot product-ed with the measured IQ to distill the
  result into a single IQ value

Again it is up to the hardware vendor to determine the parameters and write a
kernel definition at the top-level, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Minimum requirement
   kernel capture(channel chan, frame output) -> complex[32];

   // A capture command that returns an iq value
   kernel capture(channel chan, waveform filter, frame output) -> complex[32];

   // A capture command that returns a discrimnated bit
   kernel capture(channel chan, waveform filter, frame output) -> bit;

   // A capture command that returns a raw waveform data
   kernel capture(channel chan, length len, frame output) -> waveform;

The return type of a ``capture`` command varies. It could be a raw trace, ie. a
list of samples taken over a short period of time. It could be some averaged IQ
value. It could be a classified bit. Or it could even have no return value,
pushing the results into some buffer which is then accessed outside the program.

For example, the ``capture`` instruction could return raw waveform data that is then
discriminated using user-defined boxcar and discrimnation ``kernel``s.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Use a boxcar function to generate IQ data from raw waveform
    kernel boxcar(waveform input) -> complex[64];
    // Use a linear discriminator to generate bits from IQ data
    kernel discriminate(complex[64] iq) -> bit;

    defcal measure $0 -> bit {
        // Define the channels
        txchannel m0 = txch($0, "measure");
        rxchannel cap0 = rxch($0, "capture");

        // Force time of carrier to 0 for consistent phase for discrimination.
        frame stimulus_frame = newframe(5e9, 0);
        frame capture_frame = newframe(5e9, 0);

        // Apply measurement stimulus
        waveform meas_wf = gaussian_square(1.0, 16000dt, 262dt, 13952dt);

        // Play the stimulus
        play(m0, meas_wf, stimulus_frame);
        // Align measure and capture channels
        barrier(stimulus_frame, capture_frame);
        // Capture transmitted data after interaction with measurement resonator
        // kernel capture(channel chan, frame capture_frame) -> waveform;
        waveform raw_output = receive(cap0, meas_pulse.duration);

        // Kernel and discriminate
        complex[32] iq = boxcar(raw_output);
        bit result = discriminate(iq);

        return result;
    }


Timing
------

Each frame maintains its own "clock". When a pulse is played the clock for
that frame advances by the length of the pulse.

For frames, everything behaves analogous to qubits in the
`Delays <delays.html>`_ section of this specification. There are however some
small differences.

The ``delay`` instruction may take a frame instead of a qubit. The ``barrier``
instruction may also take a list of frames instead of a list of qubits and aligns the time
of the clocks given as arguments.

``defcal`` blocks have an implicit ``barrier`` on every frame that enters the block,
meaning that those clocks are guaranteed to be aligned at the start of the block.
These blocks also need to have a well-defined length, similar to the ``boxas`` block.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cal {
     waveform p = ...; // some 100dt waveform
     frame driveframe1 = newframe(5.0e9, 0);
     frame driveframe2 = newframe(6.0e9, 0);
   }

   defcal aligned_gates {
     // driveframe1 and driveframe2 used in this defcal, so clocks are aligned
     play(tx0, p, driveframe1);
     delay[20dt] driveframe1;
     // Clocks now unaligned by 120dt, so we use a `barrier` to re-align
     barrier(driveframe1, driveframe2);
     // `driveframe2` will now play a pulse 120dt after `driveframe1` finishes playing
     play(tx0, p, driveframe2);
   }

Examples
--------

Cross-resonance gate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. code-block:: javascript

  cal {
     frame frame0 = newframe(5.0e9, 0);
  }

  defcal cross_resonance $0 $1 {
      // Access globally defined channels
      channel d0 = txch($0, "drive");
      channel d1 = txch($1, "drive");

      waveform wf1 = gaussian_square(1., 1024dt, 128dt, 32dt);
      waveform wf2 = gaussian_square(0.1, 1024dt, 128dt, 32dt);

      // phase update some virtual Z gate
      frame0.phase += pi/2;

      /*** Do pre-rotation ***/
      {...}

      // generate new frame for second drive that is locally scoped
      frame temp_frame = copyframe(frame0);
      temp_frame.phase = frame0.phase + pi/2;

      play(d0, wf1, frame0);
      play(d1, wf2, temp_frame);

      /*** Do post-rotation ***/
      {...}
  }

Geometric gate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

  float[32] fq_01 = 5e9; // hardcode or pull from some function
  float[32] anharm = 300e6; // hardcode or pull from some function
  cal {
      frame frame_01 = newframe(fq_01, 0);
      frame frame_12 = newframe(fq_01 + anharm, 0);
  }

  defcal geo_gate(angle[32] theta) $0 {
      // theta: rotation angle (about z-axis) on Bloch sphere

      // Access globally defined channels
      tx_channel dq = txch($q, “drive”);

      // Assume we have calibrated 0->1 pi pulses and 1->2 pi pulse
      // envelopes (no sideband)
      waveform X_01 = {...};
      waveform X_12 = {...};
      float[32] a = sin(theta/2);
      float[32] b = sqrt(1-a**2);

      // Double-tap
      play(dq, scale(a, X_01), frame_01);
      play(dq, scale(b, X_12), frame_12);
      play(dq, scale(a, X_01), frame_01);
      play(dq, scale(b, X_12), frame_12);
  }

Neutral atoms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this simple example, the signal chain is composed of two electro-optic modulators (EOM) and
an acousto-optic deflector (AOD). The EOMs put sidebands on the laser light while the AOD diffracts
the light in an amount proportional to the frequency of the RF drive. This example was chosen
because it is similar in spirit to the work by Levine et al.:cite:`levine2019` except that phase
control is exerted using virtual Z gates on the AODs -- requiring frame tracking of the qubit
frequency yet application of a tone that maps to the qubit position (i.e. requires the use of a
sideband).

The program aims to perform a Hahn echo sequence on q1, and a Ramsey sequence on q2 and q3.

.. code-block:: javascript

  defcal neutral_atoms {
    // Access globally defined channels
    channel eom_a_channel = txch(0, "eom_a");
    channel eom_a_channel = txch(1, "eom_b");
    channel aod_channel = txch(0, "aod");

    // Define the Raman frames, which are detuned by an amount Δ from the  5S1/2 to 5P1/2 transition
    // and offset from each other by the qubit_freq
    frame raman_a_frame = newframe(Δ, 0.0)
    frame raman_b_frame = newframe(Δ-qubit_freq, 0.0)

    // Three copies of qubit freq to track phase of each qubit
    frame q1_frame = newframe(qubit_freq, 0)
    frame q2_frame = newframe(qubit_freq, 0)
    frame q3_frame = newframe(qubit_freq, 0)

    // Generic gaussian envelope
    waveform π_half_sig = gaussian(..., π_half_time, ...)

    // Waveforms ultimately supplied to the AODs. We mix our general Gaussian pulse with a sine wave to
    // put a sideband on the signal construction to target the qubit position while maintainig the
    // desired Rabi rate.
    waveform q1_π_half_sig = mix(π_half_sig, sine(q1_π_half_amp, q1_pos_freq-qubit_freq, 0.0, π_half_time));
    waveform q2_π_half_sig = mix(π_half_sig, sine(q2_π_half_amp, q2_pos_freq-qubit_freq, 0.0, π_half_time));
    waveform q3_π_half_sig = mix(π_half_sig, sine(q3_π_half_amp, q3_pos_freq-qubit_freq, 0.0, π_half_time));

    for τ in [0: T]:
        // Simultaneous π/2 pulses
        play(eom_a_channel, constant(raman_a_amp, π_half_time) , raman_a_frame);
        play(eom_b_channel, constant(raman_b_amp, π_half_time) , raman_b_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q1_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q2_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q3_frame);

        // Time delay all
        delay(τ/2)

        // π pulse on qubit 1 only -- composed of two π/2 pulses
        for _ in [0:1]:
            play(eom_a_channel, constant(raman_a_amp, π_half_time) , raman_a_frame);
            play(eom_b_channel, constant(raman_b_amp, π_half_time) , raman_b_frame);
            play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q1_frame);

        // Barrier all then time delay all
        barrier();
        delay(τ/2);

        // Phase shift the signals by a different amount
        q1_frame.phase += tppi_1 * τ;
        q2_frame.phase += tppi_2 * τ;
        q3_frame.phase += tppi_3 * τ;

        // Simultaneous π/2 pulses
        play(eom_a_channel, constant(raman_a_amp, π_half_time) , raman_a_frame);
        play(eom_b_channel, constant(raman_b_amp, π_half_time) , raman_b_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q1_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q2_frame);
        play(aod_channel, q1_π_half_sig, q3_frame);
  }

Multiplexed readout and capture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we want to perform readout and capture of a pair of qubits, but mediated by a
single physical tx and rx channel. The example is for just two qubits, but works the same for
many (just adding more frames, waveforms, plays, and captures).

.. code-block:: javascript

  defcal multiplexed_readout_and_capture $0 $1 {

      // the tx/rx channel is the same for $0 and $1
      channel ro_tx = txch($0, "readout");
      channel ro_rx = rxch($0, "readout");

      // readout frames of different frequencies
      frame q0_frame = newframe(q0_ro_freq, 0); // time 0
      frame q1_frame = newframe(q1_ro_freq, 0); // time 0

      // flat-top readout waveforms
      waveform q0_ro_wf = constant(amp=0.1, l=...);
      waveform q1_ro_wf = constant(amp=0.2, l=...);

      // multiplexed readout
      play(ro_tx, q0_ro_wf, q0_frame);
      play(ro_tx, q1_ro_wf, q1_frame);

      // simple boxcar kernel
      waveform ro_kernel = constant(amp=1, l=...);

      // multiplexed capture
      // kernel capture(channel chan, waveform ro_kernel, frame capture_frame) -> bit;
      bit q0_bit = capture(ro_rx, ro_kernel, q0_frame);
      bit q1_bit = capture(ro_rx, ro_kernel, q1_frame);
      ...
  }


Sample rate collisions
-----------------------

Incommensurate Rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the frame can be played on multiple channels, there may be an issue with sample rates.
For example,

.. code-block:: javascript

  defcal incommensurate_rates_interval $q
    channel tx0 = txch(0, "tx0"); # sample per 1 ns
    channel tx1 = txch(1, "tx1"); # sample per 2 ns

    waveform wf = gaussian_square(0.1, 13ns, ...);

    play(tx0, wf, driveframe);
    // now driveframe.time is at 13ns
    play(tx1, wf, driveframe); // does not support 13 ns -- either 12ns or 14 ns
  }

The implementation of this behavior is up to the vendor.

Incommensurate Lengths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the samples are defined dt, then playing the same waveform on two different channels
produces

.. code-block:: javascript

  defcal incommensurate_lengths $q
    channel tx0 = txch(0, "tx0"); # sample per 1 ns
    channel tx1 = txch(1, "tx1"); # sample per 2 ns

    waveform wf = gaussian_square(0.1, 12dt, ...); // this means different lengths to different channels

    play(tx0, wf, driveframe);
    // now driveframe.time is at 12ns
    play(tx1, wf, driveframe);
    // now driveframe.time is at 36ns
  }

This is considered well-defined behavior.
