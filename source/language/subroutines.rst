Subroutines
===========

Subroutines are declared using the statement::

    def name(parameters) -> output_type { body }

Subroutines and their named arguments must be named according to the rules for
identifiers (See :ref:`identifiers`).

The subroutine will define zero or more parameters as input, consisting of both
quantum and classical arguments. Quantum bits and classical values are passed to
the subroutine by reference or name, while classical types are passed in by value.
All arguments are declared together with their type. For example, ``qubit ancilla``
defines a quantum bit argument named ``ancilla``.

A given qubit can be passed at most once in any subroutine call.  Different
``qubit`` arguments (whether single bits or registers) cannot refer to the same
underlying qubit in a call.

Subroutines return up to one value of classical type, signified by the
``return`` keyword. If there is no return value, the empty ``return``
keyword may be used to immediately exit from the subroutine, which implicitly
returns the :ref:`void type <void-type>`. Subroutines that
do not return a value must be declared with no output signature::

    def name(parameters) { body }

Qubit declarations are not allowed within subroutines as those declarations are global.

A subroutine is invoked with the syntax ``name(parameters)`` and may be assigned
to an ``output`` as needed via an assignment operator (``=``, ``+=``, etc).

Using subroutines, we can define an X-basis measurement with the program::

    def xmeasure(qubit q) -> bit { h q; return measure q; }

We can also define more general classes of single-qubit measurements
as::

    def pmeasure(angle[32] theta, qubit q) -> bit {
      rz(theta) q;
      h q;
      return measure q;
   }

The type declarations are necessary if we want to mix qubit and
register arguments. For example, we might define a parity check
subroutine that takes qubits and registers::

   def xcheck(qubit[4] d, qubit a) -> bit {
     reset a;
     for int i in [0: 3] cx d[i], a;
     return measure a;
   }

Naturally we can also use subroutines to define purely classical
operations, such as methods we can implement using low-level classical
instructions, like::

   const n = /* some size, known at compile time */;
   def parity(bit[n] cin) -> bit {
     bit c;
     for int i in [0: n - 1] {
       c ^= cin[i];
     }
     return c;
   }

We can make some measurements and call this subroutine on the results as
follows::

   qubit q;
   qubit r;
   c = measure q;
   c2 = measure r;
   bit result;
   result = parity(c ++ c2);

We require that we know the signature at compile time, as we do in this
example. We could also just as easily have used an extern function for
this::

   const n = /* size of c + size of c2 */;
   extern parity(bit[n]) -> bit;
   qubit q;
   qubit r;
   c = measure q;
   c2 = measure r;
   bit result;
   result = parity(c ++ c2);

Arrays in subroutines
---------------------

Arrays may be passed as parameters to subroutines and externs. All array
parameters are passed as references and must include a type modifier specifying
if the parameter is ``readonly`` or ``mutable``. The number of dimensions for all
array parameters must be specified using the ``#dim = const expression``
syntax below, or specific lengths for each dimension must be provided.
The unspecified-length version is provided because the lengths of
the dimensions of array parameters (in the case of strided access) may not be
known until runtime. The array references defined using the unspecified-length
syntax have a different type from the ones defined using specific lengths for
each dimension. Passing multiple overlapping mutable references to the same
array to a subroutine is forbidden. However, the compiler will not always be
able to resolve when this happens, and if it does, then no guarantees are made
about the order that updates are made in.

.. code-block::

   def specified_sub(readonly array[int[8], 2, 10] arr_arg) { /* ... */ }
   def arr_subroutine(readonly array[int[8], #dim = 1] arr_arg) { /* ... */ }
   def mut_subroutine(mutable array[int[8], #dim = 1] arr_arg) {
     arr_arg[2] = 10; // allowed
     // ...
   }
   array[int[8], 5] aa;
   array[int[8], 3, 5] bb;

   arr_subroutine(aa);
   arr_subroutine(bb[1, 0:3]);
   mut_subroutine(aa[1:3]); // aa[3] = 10

The lifetime of the array reference is limited to within the scope of the
subroutine definition, but it should be noted that since arrays are not
dynamically allocated the memory associated with the array stays intact after
subroutine exit. Additionally, the OpenQASM3 language is not anticipated to
support explicit user-controlled creation of pointers and references outside
of the specific context of passing arrays to subroutines.

The dimensions of arrays may be queried inside of subroutines using the built-in
``sizeof()`` function, which takes two parameters: the array being queried, and
the zero-based dimension number requested. If the second parameter is omitted,
then it defaults to ``0``, *i.e.* ``sizeof(arr) == sizeof(arr, 0)``.
``sizeof()`` returns a ``uint`` when querying an array reference defined using
the unspecified-length syntax, and a ``const uint`` when querying an array defined
using specific lengths for each dimension. In both cases the return value represents
the length of the requested dimension of the array argument. The array argument can be
subscripted, meaning that ``sizeof(arr[0], 0) == sizeof(arr, 1)``.

.. code-block::

   def unspecified_length_arr_subroutine(readonly array[int[8], #dim = 2] twoD_arg) {
     uint[32] firstDim  = sizeof(twoD_arg, 0);
     uint[32] secondDim = sizeof(twoD_arg, 1);
     int[32] sum = 0;
     for int ii in [0:firstDim-1] {
       for int jj in [0:secondDim-1] {
         sum += int[32](twoD_arg[ii][jj]);
       }
     }
     // ...
   }

.. code-block::

   def specific_length_arr_subroutine(readonly array[int[8], 3, 4] twoD_arg) {
     const uint[32] firstDim  = sizeof(twoD_arg, 0);
     const uint[32] secondDim = sizeof(twoD_arg, 1);
     int[32] sum = 0;
     for int ii in [0:firstDim-1] {
       for int jj in [0:secondDim-1] {
         sum += int[32](twoD_arg[ii][jj]);
       }
     }
     // ...
   }

Note that while bit and qubit registers such as ``bit[n] b`` and ``qubit[n] q`` in some
contexts operate in ways reminiscent of arrays (in particular, indexing is a natural
operation on such varaibles), variables of neither type are valid arguments to
``sizeof()``.
